Mobile App Dev Project

I made the to do list app with the tabs template.
Deleted the the third tab as i didnt need it.
Changed the names of both tabs to list and add Task.
Added a list to the list tab and a textbox and button for the add task tab. 

App is simply used by typing a task into the the add task area and and pressing submit.
This adds the task to the todo list which can be seen in the list tab.
